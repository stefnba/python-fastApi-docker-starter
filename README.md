# Database

## Migrations

Database migrations are done through [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) and the [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) engine. To simplify the commands, we use [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com).

Create a new migration file:

```bash
make migrate-create name=<name of migration file>
```

Run up migrations:

```bash
make migrate-up
```

Run down migrations:

```bash
make migrate-down
```
